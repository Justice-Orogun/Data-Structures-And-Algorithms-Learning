## Linked List

This is a linear collection of data elements in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
Each element points to the next.

This is a data structure that consist of a group of nodes that together represents a sequence.

Each node consist of data and reference to the next element.
This structure allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iterations.

A drawback of LinkedList is that access time is linear(0^n). Faster access such as random is not feasible. Arrays have a better cache locality as compared to Linked LIst.
