## Stack

This is an `abstract` data structure that uses the real-life stack analogy in organizing data elements
It is a `linear` data structure because data elements are organized in a sequence.
Stack can also be called a `LIFO` data structure since it borrows from a real stack of items where the last item that is added to the stack is always the first one to be removed hence the name.
Stack has got two main operations `push()` and ` pop()`
`push()` adds an item to the top of the stack.
`pop()` removes the most recently added item from the `stack`.
It also has the `peek()` operation which returns the top most item without modifying the stack.

### Applications of the Stack

A Stack can be used for evaluating expressions consisting of operands and operators.
Stacks can be used for Backtracking, i.e., to check parenthesis matching in an expression.
It can also be used to convert one form of expression to another form.
It can be used for systematic Memory Management.
