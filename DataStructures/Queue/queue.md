## Queue

This is another `abstract` data structure. It is also termed as a `linear` data structure since data elements are organized in a sequence.
It has two main operations that can be used to remove or add data items to the queue.
It also has the same implementation as the real-world queue hence it can also be called a `FIFO` data structure since the first element that is added to the queue gets removed first.
Newly added elements can not be removed from the queue before all the elements that were added before it are removed.
The two main operations are:
`enqueue` which involves adding items to the queue.
`dequeue` which involves removing items from the queue.
