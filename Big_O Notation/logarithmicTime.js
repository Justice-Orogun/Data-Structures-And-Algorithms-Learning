Logarithmic algorithm

1. An algorithm is said to run in logarithmic time if its time execution 
   is proportional to the logarithm of the input size, and we mark it as O(log n).

2. O(log n) algorithms never look at all the elements in the input. logarithmic 
   time complexities usually apply to algorithms that eliminate large amounts of input elements in each step.

// O(log n) => Time Complexity
